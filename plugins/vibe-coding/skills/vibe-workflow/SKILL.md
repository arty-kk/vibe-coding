# Проверки и обслуживание процесса

Read [the shared workflow](../../references/workflow.md) once per task, then the one recipe matching the requested operation and boundary. Do not load every recipe. The user's request controls scope and whether edits are allowed.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Operation |
|---|---|
| [Behavior Check](references/behavior-check.md) | check |
| [Evidence Normalization](references/evidence-normalization.md) | plan |
| [Map Refresh Polish](references/map-refresh-polish.md) | implement |
| [Map Staleness Check](references/map-staleness-check.md) | check |
| [Prompt Skill Sync Audit](references/prompt-skill-sync-audit.md) | audit |
| [Prompt Skill Sync Polish](references/prompt-skill-sync-polish.md) | implement |
| [Scoped Audit](references/scoped-audit.md) | audit |
| [Scoped Polish](references/scoped-polish.md) | implement |

For an explicit multi-stage request, follow the necessary stages without discarding requested work. For a single stage, deliver that result and stop. Use [the catalog](../../references/catalog.md) only if the requested boundary belongs elsewhere.
