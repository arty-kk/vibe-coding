# Test Coverage Audit

## Operation

Inspect the named boundary and report supported findings. Do not edit product code. Include concrete evidence, impact, the owning source, one remediation direction and a meaningful validation route. Severity follows actual impact, not a category example.

## Goal

Find critical behavior that is untested, falsely tested, or fragile enough to allow regressions. Keep coverage gaps that matter to correctness, contracts, security, UX, or operability.

## Inspect

Tests, test utilities, fixtures, mocks, snapshots, coverage config, CI workflows, package scripts, product/traceability/test maps when present, and the source behavior those tests claim to protect. Include generated maps/docs only as discovery aids.

## Coverage issues

- Missing tests for reachable critical behavior, product acceptance, RBAC/ABAC decisions, payment/provider events, notification delivery, cache/search freshness, feature-flag states, mobile offline paths, extension permissions, or desktop local-runtime boundaries.
- Tests that assert implementation details while missing observable behavior.
- Mocks/stubs that bypass the risk being tested.
- Snapshot-only or smoke-only coverage for behavior with branching rules.
- Flaky-risk patterns: real timers/network, order coupling, shared mutable state, nondeterministic data, unawaited async work.
- CI not running the tests that protect important behavior.
- Tests or fixtures that encode outdated contracts and would hide regressions.

## Priority model

Missing or false coverage for security, data integrity, payment, tenant isolation, destructive mutation, migration, or externally visible contract.

Missing meaningful coverage for important workflows, state transitions, error handling, integration boundaries, UI/API behavior, or hot paths likely to regress.

Lower-risk but useful coverage improvement for misleading tests, flaky risk, weak assertions, or unverified edge states.

## Task-sub quality

- Use task briefs creation when available; do not force a handmade markdown task brief body.
- Every task brief must cite `path:line[-line]` evidence for the problematic behavior/contract and the owner layer, plus symbol when possible.
- Include reachable surface, affected actors/consumers/states, expected behavior, acceptance criteria, and validation direction when discoverable.
- Use one unambiguous fix direction per task brief; no alternatives.
- Merge symptoms under the same behavior owner/source of truth unless fixes, rollout units, or validation differ.
- Do not report theoretical risks, stylistic preferences, or generic best practices without current repo impact.
- Cite both the behavior owner and the missing/weak test evidence.
- Make each task brief about adding or repairing tests for one behavior owner and state the expected observable assertion.
- Do not create product-code change tasks unless the code is untestable because of a demonstrated behavior-boundary problem.
