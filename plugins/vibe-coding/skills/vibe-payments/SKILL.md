Read [the shared workflow](../../references/workflow.md) once per task, then the one recipe matching the requested operation and boundary. Do not load every recipe. The user's request controls scope and whether edits are allowed.

## Recipes

| Recipe | Operation |
|---|---|
| [Payments Provider Audit](references/payments-provider-audit.md) | audit |
| [Payments Provider Polish](references/payments-provider-polish.md) | implement |
| [Payments Webhook & Reconciliation Check](references/payments-webhook-reconciliation-check.md) | check |

For an explicit multi-stage request, follow the necessary stages without discarding requested work. For a single stage, deliver that result and stop. Use [the catalog](../../references/catalog.md) only if the requested boundary belongs elsewhere.
